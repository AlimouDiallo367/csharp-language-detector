# CSharp Language Detector 

## Overview 

This C# project is designed to develop and demonstrate proficiency in several key areas within a WPF application:

The core technical focus is mastering Asynchronous Programming (`async`/`await`) and consuming an authenticated external RESTful API to detect the language of user-provided text.

The project also solidifies understanding of the MVVM Architecture and Configuration Management.
